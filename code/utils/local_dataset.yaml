# YOLO11 Dataset Configuration - Local Cricket Ball Dataset  
# Finetune on this domain-specific dataset (230 images from your videos)

path: /home/ananya/agentic_ai/edgefleet/dataset_local  # Root directory
train: train/images  # Will be created by split script
val: val/images
test: test/images

# Classes
nc: 1  # Number of classes
names: ['ball']  # Class names

# Dataset Statistics
# Total: 230 annotated frames from 15 videos
# These are from your preprocessed cricket ball footage
# Higher quality, domain-specific annotations

# IMPORTANT: Must split by VIDEO to prevent data leakage
# Use create_video_splits.py to organize into train/val/test

# Recommended training parameters for finetuning
# epochs: 30-50
# imgsz: 640 (or 1280 for small objects)
# batch: 8 (smaller for finetuning)
# lr0: 0.001 (lower LR for finetuning)
# Resume from Kaggle-trained weights: model=runs/train/kaggle/weights/best.pt
